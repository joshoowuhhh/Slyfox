      <h2>. . . GREENISKI . . .</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        My speculative future takes place during the year 4226 on the planet that is called “Greeniski.” Greeniski is similar to Earth regarding water and land. The land that exists on Greeniski is mostly forestry and jungle biomes. These forestry and jungle biomes include aspects such as tall grass and trees, vines, lots of rain, hot and humid weather, vegetation, and unique wildlife. There is some speculation that there is humanity since there are forms of old technology that exist on Greeniski, but it is yet to be determined. From the outside looking in, it seems to be that Greeniski is prospering and shows no signs of environmental damage. I want viewers to immerse themselves in an ideal world or universe where nature is thriving and displays what the future holds if we chose to make better and healthier choices with our dear planet.
      </p>

      <p2>
        My spacecraft is named SLYFOX 2601 and it is one of the oldest spacecrafts that exists on Greeniski. The origin and purpose of SLYFOX 2601 before arriving on Greeniski were that it was used to be an attack jet, but when discovered, the weapons such as the turrets and missiles were removed. There is a radar located within the cockpit that indicates and alerts when wildlife and vegetation are damaged or dying. The current core purpose of SLYFOX 2601 is to patrol, navigate, and preserve the environment of Greeniski whether that is transporting cargo or shooting beams of “health” that heal whatever assets need to be assisted.
